  <p>Each RCBB event will consist of seven rounds of questions on all things literature! There will also be thematically-related songs played throughout the event!</p>
  <h2>LIGHTNING ROUND</h2>
  <p>This round consists of 20 "decode the emojis" puzzles, in which you have to match a sequence of emojis to a title. Your answers must be submitted in approximately 4 minutes.</p>
  <h2>BETTING ROUND</h2>
  <p>In this round, you will have to decide how to allocate point values of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 between 5 questions. Make sure to assign greater point values to the questions you are more confident about!</p>
  <h2>COMMON BOND ROUND</h2>
  <p>This round consists of 5 questions, the answers to which all share a hidden common theme. Guess the common theme correctly to get extra points!</p>
  <h2>BEFORE & AFTER ROUND</h2>
  <p>Each question in this round will clue two different works, and the answer will be some combination of the titles. For example, you could have a question like "A John Grisham courtroom drama about the unlikely friendship between Scout Finch and Boo Radley:, to which the answer is <strong><em>A Time to Kill a Mockingbird</em></strong>. In this case, the two novels in question are <em>A Time to Kill</em> and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em></p>
  <h2>VISUAL ROUND</h2>
  <p>In this round, you will come up to the front of the room and try to identify the covered-up book covers that are on display.</p>
  <h2>3-2-1 ROUND</h2>
  <p>In this round, you will get three hints to identify a book. If you get the question after the first hint, you will get 3 points. If you get the question after the second hint, you will get 2 points. If you get the question after the third hint, you will get 1 point. However, you only get one opportunity to guess! So choose carefully!</p>
  <h2>HEAD TO HEAD ROUND</h2>
  <p>This round is a sort of "sped-up" version of the previous round contested between the top two teams. So you will receive a series of hints all in a row, and the first team to "ring in" with a bell will get to answer the question. But like the previous round, each team will only get one attempt to guess per question! After successfully answering a question, a team will then get a "bonus" question", which will be an easy, medium, and hard question on a common subject.</p>
