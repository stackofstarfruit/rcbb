For example, you could have a question like &quot;A John Grisham courtroom drama about the unlikely friendship between Scout Finch and Boo Radley:&quot;, to which the answer is <strong><em>A Time to Kill a Mockingbird</em></strong>. In this case, the two novels in question are <em>A Time to Kill</em> and <em>To Kill a Mockingbird</em>.</p></section> <section class="mx-auto p-8 max-w-4xl bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-lg my-8"><h2 class="text-4xl text-blue-900 mb-4">VISUAL ROUND</h2> <p class="text-gray-700">In this round, you will come up to the front of the room and try to identify the covered-up book covers that are on display.</p></section> <section class="mx-auto p-8 max-w-4xl bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-lg my-8"><h2 class="text-4xl text-blue-900 mb-4">3-2-1 ROUND</h2> <p class="text-gray-700">In this round, you will get three hints to identify a book.

So you will receive a series of hints all in a row, and the first team to &quot;ring in&quot; with a bell will get to answer the question. But like the previous round, each team will only get one attempt to guess per question! After successfully answering a question, a team will then get a &quot;bonus&quot; question&quot;, which will be an easy, medium, and hard question on a common subject.</p></section> <footer class="mx-auto p-8 max-w-4xl bg-white rounded-3xl shadow-lg my-8 text-center"><p class="text-gray-700">Click <a href="/" class="text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800">here</a> to go back to home.</p></footer></div>`;
